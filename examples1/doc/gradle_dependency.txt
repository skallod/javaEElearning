You have two independent projects and you need to use one of them as a dependency

When both project are on the same level in a directory structure you are not doing it as gradle team wish, but it is more real world situation in my opinion :) This is because you have your library project that can be easily used in several other projects as a dependency.

So you have directory structure like this:

Project
  |--build.gradle
  |--settings.gradle
Dependency
  |--build.gradle
To add Dependency to the Project, you need to include it, and show Dependency path manually. So the Project/settings.gradle content should be like this:

include ':Dependency'
project(':Dependency').projectDir = new File(settingsDir, '../Dependency')
and in a Project/build.gradle dependencies section you need to compile the dependent project by adding:

dependencies {
   compile project(':Dependency')
}
Notice that tis is build.gradle is exactly the same as in previous section.
