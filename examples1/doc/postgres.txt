find the file pg_hba.conf - it may be located, for example in /etc/postgresql-9.1/pg_hba.conf.
cd /etc/postgresql-9.1/
Back it up
cp pg_hba.conf pg_hba.conf-backup
place the following line (as either the first uncommented line, or as the only one):
local  all   all   trust
restart your PostgreSQL server (e.g., on Linux:)
sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart
If the service (daemon) doesn't start reporting in log file:
local connections are not supported by this build
you should change
local  all   all   trust
to
host  all   all  127.0.0.1/32  trust
you can now connect as any user. Connect as the superuser postgres (note, the superuser name may be different in your installation. In some systems it is called pgsql, for example.)
psql -U postgres
or
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres
(note that with the first command you will not always be connected with local host)
Reset password
ALTER USER my_user_name with password 'my_secure_password';
Restore the old pg_hba.conf as it is very dangerous to keep around
cp pg_hba.conf-backup pg_hba.conf
restart the server, in order to run with the safe pg_hba.conf
sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart

!! change pg_hba.conf local postgre md5
peer - means that connect should be with current OS user
